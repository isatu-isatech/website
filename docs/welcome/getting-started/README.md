# Getting Started

### What You'll Need (Prerequisites)

Before you can get this project up and running on your computer, make sure you have these tools installed. Don't worry if you don't have them yet â€“ links are included to help you out!

* **Node.js (v18.x or newer recommended)**
  * This is the runtime that powers our project.
  * **Get it here:** Download directly from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **npm (Node Package Manager)**
  * `npm` usually comes bundled when you install Node.js, so you likely already have it. We use it to manage all the project's dependencies.
  * _Prefer something else?_ You can also use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) if that's what you're used to.
* **Git**
  * You'll need Git to download (clone) the project from GitHub.
  * **Get it here:** Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
* **(Optional but Recommended) Visual Studio Code**
  * While you can use any code editor, VS Code is fantastic for web development. We often use it with extensions like Prettier (for consistent code formatting) and ESLint (to catch common coding issues) to make development smoother.
  * **Get it here:** Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
